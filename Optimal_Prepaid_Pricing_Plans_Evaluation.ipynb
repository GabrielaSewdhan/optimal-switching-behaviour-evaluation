    "### Abstract\n",
    "\n",
    "One new trending feature of Smartphones is the support for E-SIM (Embedded Subscriber Identification Module) cards. These allow the user to simultaneously subscribe to multiple cellular providers while also supporting at most one physical SIM (Subscriber Identification Module) card. This feature allows customers to easily switch between providers and is especially useful for those who use prepaid plans which are popular in developing countries. A customer may have multiple providers and, at any point in time, can choose the provider with the most cost effective data plan. This means that cellular providers must consider soft-churn, where the consumer dynamically switches between multiple plans from multiple providers, in addition to the more traditional churn, where a consumer switches providers. This means that data pricing for such consumers must now be more personalized in order to be competitive and maximize profits. We determine the optimal personalized prepaid plan for such users, while providing a competitive advantage to the provider. Examples are provided to demonstrate the benefit, and numerical results corroborate our premise that personalized over traditional pricing plans can improve the revenue of the provider.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook has the code developed to evaluate the switching behavior of customers, and produce the graphs shown under the Numerical Results section of the paper."
